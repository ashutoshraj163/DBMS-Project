## Original User Request:
The Hotel Management System (HMS) I’ve designed addresses these shortcomings by implementing a DBMS-based platform that centralizes and automates hotel operations. As a student project, it demonstrates how database principles can solve real-world problems while offering a scalable, user-friendly solution for hoteliers. Below are the key features and benefits of the proposed system:
3.1 Key Features

Billing and Invoicing Automation: The system calculates charges (room rates, taxes, additional services like laundry or dining) and generates detailed invoices, reducing manual errors and speeding up checkout.
•
Staff Management Tools: Managers can assign tasks (e.g., cleaning, maintenance) to staff, track progress, and monitor performance, with role-based access ensuring data security.
